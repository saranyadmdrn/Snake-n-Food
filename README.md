Snake, the classic arcade game in which a player uses arrow keys to collect food and deviate from the walls. The player can start the game by pressing the space bar. The snake grows as it feeds on the food and the score increases as it eats. When the snake collides with the wall or with itself, the score is reset and the snake goes back to the size it was initially when the game started. Additionally, the previous score of the user is updated as well.
